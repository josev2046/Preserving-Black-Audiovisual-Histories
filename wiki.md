# Save Your Archive: Black Lives – Historical Friendships and the King’s Men

**Save Your Archive: Black Lives – Historical Friendships and the King’s Men** was a collaborative archival preservation project led by DOKUMENTA.VIDEO, aimed at digitising and providing access to endangered audiovisual records documenting Black histories and experiences. The initiative, supported by the FIAT/IFTA Save Your Archive programme, focused on preserving materials from Ghana, South Africa, and the United Kingdom that were at risk due to media obsolescence. The project was presented at the FIAT/IFTA 2022 World Conference in Cape Town.

## Background

The project was launched to address the underrepresentation of Black voices in audiovisual archives and to ensure the long-term accessibility of historical materials. Many of the audiovisual records involved were stored in deteriorating obsolete formats such as Beta SP, D1, D2 tapes, and ¼ inch audio reels, making them inaccessible to researchers and the public. The project was led by DOKUMENTA.VIDEO, a creative partnership between journalist Dr. David Dunkley-Gyimah (Ph.D.) and documentarian José Velazquez (M.A.), holding specialisms in academia, journalism, storytelling, major television production, and data architecture and advisories.

Through a combination of digitisation, metadata enrichment, and collaboration with academic institutions, the project sought to preserve, catalogue, and contextualise these materials for academic and non-commercial research.

## Collections Preserved

The project encompassed the preservation of three distinct audiovisual collections:

* Reverend Sidney Pearson and Nana Prempeh I – Archival footage documenting the friendship between an English Reverend Sidney Pearson and Nana Prempeh I, the King of the Ashanti in Ghana. The materials included recordings of their collaboration in establishing Prempeh College, often referred to as the “African Eton”.
* Ghana-South African Co-production for Channel One – Production materials from a major television co-production between Ghana and South Africa, showcasing early transnational media collaborations.
* BBC Black London – Rare audio recordings from the BBC Black London series, featuring interviews with prominent Black cultural figures such as Eartha Kitt, Alice Walker, and Quincy Jones.

## Objectives

The primary aims of the project included:

* Digitisation of endangered audiovisual materials to prevent data loss.
* Preservation by transferring content from obsolete carriers to digital formats.
* Metadata enrichment to ensure comprehensive descriptions and ease of access.
* Creation of a searchable Media Asset Management (MAM) system for cataloguing and retrieval.
* Public accessibility for academic research and non-commercial use.
* Inclusion of Black narratives in historical records to provide a more complete representation of cultural and media history.

## Methodology

The project followed a collaborative archival approach, combining expertise from digitisation professionals, academic institutions, and media archivists. The key steps included:

* Archive Retrieval and Assessment – Identifying and cataloguing endangered materials.
* Digitisation – Conducted by Memnon and LMH, ensuring high-fidelity digital preservation.
* Media Asset Management (MAM) System – Establishing a structured digital repository.
* Metadata Enrichment – Implementing a customised metadata schema to enhance discoverability.
* Academic Collaboration – Partnering with institutions such as Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Culture for research and contextualisation.
* Dissemination – Sharing findings through conferences, exhibitions, and publications.

## Results and Impact

Key outcomes included:

* Digitisation of approximately 60 hours of archival audiovisual content.
* Development of a fully searchable Media Asset Management system for academic and institutional use.
* Presentation of findings at institutions including the British Library and conferences such as the BBC 1922-2022 centenary event.
* Contributions to exhibitions, including the British Library’s “500 Years of News” exhibition.
* Publication of related research, including a chapter in Breaking in the News by David Dunkley-Gyimah.

## Challenges and Future Work

The project faced several logistical and technical challenges, including:

* Addressing media obsolescence through the strategic acquisition and utilisation of playback equipment for outdated formats.
* Brexit-related logistical issues, impacting the transportation of materials.
* COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, delaying in-person archival work.

Future plans include:

* Expanding digitisation efforts for remaining archival materials.
* Enhancing metadata for better accessibility.
* Partnering with additional institutions for wider dissemination.
* Exploring potential documentary or educational projects based on the archives.

## Significance

The Save Your Archive: Black Lives project contributed to the broader field of archival preservation and Black historical scholarship. By making these materials available to researchers and the public, the initiative supported historical research, enhanced cultural understanding, and promoted the preservation of underrepresented narratives in global media history.
