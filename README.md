# Save Your Archive: Black Lives - Historical Friendships and the King’s Men

A collaborative project preserving and providing access to endangered audiovisual archives documenting Black experiences. (Paper presented at the FIAT/IFTA 2022 World Conference in Cape Town)

## Abstract

The Black Lives project, undertaken by DOKUMENTA.VIDEO, addresses the critical need to preserve and make accessible vulnerable audiovisual archives documenting Black histories and experiences in Ghana, South Africa, and London. Through collaborative digitisation, metadata enrichment, and dissemination, this project aims to address the underrepresentation of Black narratives in historical records and promote a more comprehensive understanding of contemporary media practice.

## Introduction

This project, a recipient of the Save Your Archive initiative, focuses on the retrieval and preservation of endangered archival footage from three distinct collections, all facing the threat of loss due to obsolete formats (Beta SP, D1, D2 tapes, and ¼ inch reels):

* **Reverend Sidney Pearson and Nana Prempeh I:** Documenting the historical friendship between an English Reverend and the King of the Ashanti in Ghana, and their collaboration in building Prempeh College, often referred to as an "African Eton."
* **Ghana-South African Co-production for Channel One:** Archiving production materials from the first major co-production between Ghana and South Africa for Channel One.
* **BBC Black London:** Preserving rare audio recordings from the BBC Black London series, featuring interviews with prominent Black artists such as Eartha Kitt, Alice Walker, and Quincy Jones.

## Objectives

* Retrieve and digitise endangered audiovisual materials from the three identified collections.
* Preserve archival content by transferring it from obsolete carriers to digital formats.
* Create a searchable Media Asset Management system to manage the digital assets.
* Categorise and describe the digitised materials using professional metadata standards.
* Make accessible the audiovisual content for academic research and other non-commercial uses.
* Contribute to a more complete and representative historical record by preserving Black narratives.

## Methodology

The project, led by Dokumenta Video, employs a collaborative methodology:

* **Archive Retrieval and Assessment:** Identification, cataloguing, and physical retrieval of archival materials from various sources.
* **Digitisation:** Professional digitisation of materials by Memnon and LMH, ensuring high-quality preservation of the content.
* **Media Asset Management:** Creation of a Media Asset Management (MAM) system for efficient storage, cataloguing, and retrieval of digitised assets.
* **Metadata Enrichment:** Implementation of a bespoke metadata schema to describe individual assets, facilitating search and discovery.
* **Academic Collaboration:** Partnering with academic institutions, such as Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Culture, to research and contextualise the archival materials.
* **Dissemination:** Presenting research and findings at conferences and through publications, such as the chapter by David Dunkley-Gyimah in "Breaking in the News."

## Project Team

* **Digitisation Partners:** Memnon, LMH
* **Support:** Save Your Archive Project of FIAT/IFTA

## Dokumenta Video

Dokumenta Video is a creative partnership between journalist Dr. David Dunkley-Gyimah (Ph.D.) and documentarian José Velazquez (M.A.), holding specialisms in academia, journalism, storytelling, major television production, and data architecture and advisories.

## Results

* Digitisation of nearly 60 hours of broadcast-quality material.
* Creation of a fully searchable Media Asset Management system.
* Presentation of project findings at institutions such as the British Library.
* Contributions to publications and exhibitions, including the British Library's "500 Years of News" exhibition.
* Presentations at conferences, such as the BBC 1922-2022 conference.

## Discussion

The project faced challenges, including logistical complexities related to Brexit and the need to conduct archival work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the collaborative approach and the support of the Save Your Archive initiative enabled the successful retrieval, digitisation, and management of these valuable collections.

## Future Work

Ongoing efforts include:

* Further exploration and cataloguing of remaining archival materials.
* Continued research and contextualisation of the digitised assets.
* Development of partnerships for wider dissemination and utilisation of the archive.
* Potential collaborations with organisations to produce content related to the Reverend Sidney Pearson collection.

## Contribution

This project contributes to the preservation of endangered audiovisual heritage and addresses the underrepresentation of Black voices and perspectives in historical records. By making these materials accessible, the project supports academic research, enhances cultural understanding, and promotes a more inclusive and accurate historical narrative.
