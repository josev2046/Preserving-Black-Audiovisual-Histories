## Abstract

This paper details the “Save Your Archive: Black Lives” initiative, a collaborative project by DOKUMENTA.VIDEO. It addresses the critical need to preserve and make accessible vulnerable audiovisual archives documenting Black histories and experiences across Ghana, South Africa, and London. Through systematic **digitisation**, robust **metadata enrichment**, and strategic dissemination, this project aims to rectify the underrepresentation of Black narratives in historical records and foster a more holistic understanding of contemporary media practice. The initiative highlights the significance of preserving endangered media, exemplified by the “GLR Black London” collection, and its broader implications for cultural memory and public scholarship.

## 1. Introduction

Marginalised historical narratives face a significant threat due to the decay of physical media. For decades, the lived experiences of Black individuals across various regions, including Ghana, South Africa, and Britain, have been under-documented or absent from formal archives. The “Save Your Archive: Black Lives” initiative directly addresses this void by offering a methodological and technological intervention to ensure these vital histories are preserved and made accessible.

This paper focuses on the broader implications of digitising and contextualising Black audiovisual heritage, drawing on insights from three distinct collections: the Reverend Sidney Pearson and Nana Prempeh I collection, the Ghana-South African Co-production for Channel One materials, and the BBC Black London archive.

## 2. Project Context and Objectives

This initiative, a recipient of the FIAT/IFTA Save Your Archive grant, focuses on the retrieval and preservation of endangered archival footage from three distinct collections, all facing the threat of loss due to obsolete broadcast formats such as Beta SP, D1, D2 tapes, and ¼ inch reels. The overarching objective is not only to preserve these analogue media but also to integrate them into a digitally sustainable, searchable ecosystem, thereby reinforcing cultural memory and public scholarship.

The specific objectives of the project included:
* **Retrieval and Digitisation:** Identifying, cataloguing, and professionally digitising endangered audiovisual materials from the three identified collections.
* **Preservation:** Transferring archival content from obsolete physical carriers to robust digital formats.
* **Media Asset Management:** Establishing a searchable **Media Asset Management (MAM)** system for efficient storage, cataloguing, and retrieval of digitised assets.
* **Metadata Enrichment:** Implementing a bespoke metadata schema to thoroughly describe individual assets, facilitating precise search and discovery.
* **Accessibility:** Making the audiovisual content accessible for academic research and other non-commercial uses.
* **Historical Contribution:** Contributing to a more complete and representative historical record by preserving Black narratives.

## 3. Materials and Methods

The project, led by Dokumenta Video, employed a collaborative methodology that combined established archival practices with modern technological solutions.

### 3.1 Legacy Media Digitisation

The project focused on the preservation of obsolete broadcast formats, including Beta SP, D1, D2 tapes, and ¼ inch reels. These materials were physically retrieved from various sources, catalogued, and then professionally digitised by expert partners **Memnon** and **LMH**. This process ensured the conversion of vulnerable physical media into high-quality, preservation-grade digital assets, stored within a custom-built **Media Asset Management (MAM)** system. Metadata enhancement was prioritised through the application of a bespoke metadata schema to enable comprehensive search and discovery.

### 3.2 Media Asset Management and Accessibility

A central component of the project was the creation of a robust **Media Asset Management (MAM)** system. This system serves as the backbone for efficient storage, cataloguing, and retrieval of the digitised assets. Through meticulous metadata enrichment, individual assets are comprehensively described, making the vast repository of content easily searchable.

### 3.3 Collaborative and Dissemination Strategies

The project embraced a collaborative approach, partnering with academic institutions, such as Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Culture, to research and contextualise the archival materials. Dissemination of research and findings was achieved through presentations at conferences, including the **FIAT/IFTA 2022 World Conference in Cape Town**, and through publications, such as a chapter by Dr. David Dunkley-Gyimah in "Breaking the News" and his publication "Black London (BBC GLR 1991–1993): the Importance of a BBC Radio Archive for Black British People and Scholars." Presentations at institutions like the British Library and contributions to exhibitions like the British Library's "500 Years of News" further amplified the project's reach.

## 4. Content Overview of the Archived Collections

The digitised content offers historically significant, multi-dimensional views of Black life and historical interactions across different regions.

### 4.1 Reverend Sidney Pearson and Nana Prempeh I Collection

This collection documents the unique historical friendship between an English Reverend, Sidney Pearson, and Nana Prempeh I, the King of the Ashanti in Ghana. It highlights their collaborative efforts in establishing **Prempeh College**, often metaphorically referred to as an "African Eton," showcasing cross-cultural cooperation and educational development.

### 4.2 Ghana-South African Co-production for Channel One

This segment of the archive contains invaluable production materials from the first major co-production between Ghana and South Africa for Channel One. It provides insights into the nascent stages of media collaboration between these two African nations, reflecting evolving cultural and broadcasting landscapes.

### 4.3 BBC Black London Archive

This collection comprises rare audio recordings from the **BBC Black London series**, broadcast between 1991 and 1993. It features interviews with prominent Black artists and figures such as Eartha Kitt, Alice Walker, and Quincy Jones. As highlighted in Gyimah (2023), this material offers a unique insight into the **Black British experience**, covering themes of systemic racism, political activism, cultural production, and social justice during a pivotal period.

## 5. Results and Discussion

The “Save Your Archive: Black Lives” project successfully preserved and made accessible a substantial body of endangered audiovisual heritage.

**Key results include:**
* **Volume of Content:** The project successfully processed three distinct collections, resulting in 150 entries and nearly 60 hours (3,557.4 minutes) of broadcast-quality material.
* **Searchable System:** A fully searchable **Media Asset Management (MAM)** system was created, providing unprecedented access to these previously inaccessible materials.
* **Dissemination and Impact:** Project findings were presented at numerous institutions and conferences, including the British Library and the BBC 1922-2022 conference. Contributions were also made to significant publications and exhibitions, such as the British Library's "500 Years of News" exhibition.

While the project faced challenges, including logistical complexities stemming from Brexit and the necessity to conduct archival work during the COVID-19 pandemic, the collaborative approach and the steadfast support from the Save Your Archive initiative ensured the successful retrieval, digitisation, and management of these valuable collections. The value of these collections lies not only in their content but also in their newfound accessibility. Digitisation converts ephemeral media into durable assets, and the robust MAM system allows for nuanced queries across a corpus previously invisible to researchers.

## 6. Future Work

Ongoing efforts for the project include:
* **Archival Exploration:** Continued exploration and detailed cataloguing of remaining archival materials.
* **Research and Contextualisation:** Further in-depth research and contextualisation of the digitised assets to enhance their scholarly value.
* **Partnership Development:** Developing new partnerships for wider dissemination and utilisation of the archive, promoting broader public and academic engagement.
* **Content Production:** Potential collaborations with organisations to produce new content related to the Reverend Sidney Pearson collection, leveraging the newly preserved materials.

## 7. Contribution and Conclusion

This project makes a significant contribution to the preservation of endangered audiovisual heritage and directly addresses the historical underrepresentation of Black voices and perspectives in formal records. By making these materials accessible through methodical **digitisation** and the deployment of advanced discovery systems, the project supports crucial academic research, enhances cultural understanding, and promotes a more inclusive and accurate historical narrative. These voices, once at risk of being lost, are now available to inform public discourse, academic inquiry, and creative practice.
